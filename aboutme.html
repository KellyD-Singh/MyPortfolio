        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>Hi. My name is Kelly Dhanraj-Singh. I am currently a year 2 student pursuing a BSc. Electrical and Computer Engineering at UWI, St. Augustine.</p>
        <p>I created this website as part of my journey to learn more about web development and to showcase my projects and skills.</p>
        <p>While working on this website, I used ChatGPT to assist with writing and refining some of the code and content. This experience taught me how to integrate AI tools into the development process.</p>
        <p>Outside of my studies, I have a strong interest in software development and innovative engineering solutions. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think critically and solve complex problems.</p>
        <p>Some of my technical skills include programming in C++ and basic web development.</p>
        <p>In the future, I aspire to contribute to projects that drive technological innovation and make a meaningful impact on society.</p>
        <p>Connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelly-dhanraj-singh-5697622b6/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
